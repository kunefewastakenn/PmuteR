# PmuteR
Basic python executable for muting selected program and programs even while unfocused.



## Usage
```
- Select your program from the dropdown

- Write your keybind manually (didnt tested properly, at least ctrl+k works)

- You need to write keybind without spaces or any other things, just
[your function key] [+] [desired alphabetical key]

- With this way you can mute and unmute with that keybind
```
## Issues

This project fully depends on error and issiue reports. Issue reporting highly appreciated
